## What is a Microservice?

- Until now I have been creating a full stack application which was not so huge and scalable, but still was build using a single database, server, and it's components were not break down into services.
- A single microservice contains a single feature of our app. And that should be completly independent from other feature. So that if any of them bugs out our whole application will not crash down.
- The main point to be taken care off is data management b/w microservices.
- The two ways to manage issue is Sync and Async.
